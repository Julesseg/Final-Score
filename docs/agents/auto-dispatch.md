# Auto-dispatch: ready issues → Paseo agent sessions

Issues marked `ready-for-agent` get implemented automatically once nothing is
blocking them: a fresh Claude Code session is spawned for each one via
[Paseo](https://paseo.sh) on a self-hosted Mac runner. Sessions run on the Mac's
Claude subscription login (no API credits) and are visible in the Paseo
desktop/mobile apps.

## How it works

Two workflows split detection from execution:

1. **`unblock-dispatch.yml`** (GitHub-hosted, pure scripting) runs when an issue
   is closed as *completed*, or on a manual `workflow_dispatch`. It scans open
   `ready-for-agent` issues, parses each body's `## Blocked by` section (`- #N`
   bullets), and keeps the ones that are ready to work — never blocked, or with
   every blocker now closed. For each, it fires `agent-implement.yml` with the
   issue number and comments on the issue.
2. **`agent-implement.yml`** (self-hosted Mac runner) re-checks the issue, then
   fetches the Mac clone's remotes and runs `paseo run --detach --new-branch
   claude/issue-<N> --base origin/main … "/label-and-implement-with-pr issue #<N>"`.
   The `/label-and-implement-with-pr` skill carries the workflow instructions —
   claim the issue with the `agent-dispatched` label, run `/implement` to build
   it per AGENTS.md, then merge the base branch in, push, and open a PR that
   closes the issue. `--detach` means the session runs under the Paseo daemon
   and outlives the (short) runner job; the worktree flags keep parallel
   sessions from clobbering one checkout.

   That skill ships in this repo, at `.claude/skills/`, alongside a mirror of
   the maintainer's personal skill set. The personal copies under
   `~/.claude/skills/` are the source of truth; the repo copies exist so a
   dispatched session finds the skill in any clone, on any machine, without
   depending on how that machine's Claude config happens to be set up. When
   the personal set changes, re-copy it here.

   The mirror excludes the `paseo*` skills, which the Paseo app installs and
   updates itself (they carry a `.paseo-managed-files.json`). A committed copy
   of a file something else rewrites goes stale without anyone noticing, and
   they are machine tooling rather than project workflow. Leave them out on
   every re-sync.

### Who applies `agent-dispatched`

The session does, as its first act — never the dispatcher. The label therefore
means *a session really started on this issue*, not *a session was asked for*.
That distinction matters when the Mac runner is offline: `agent-implement.yml`
then sits queued for up to 24 h and may never run at all. A label applied at
dispatch time would leave that issue looking claimed forever, holding an
in-flight slot with nothing working it.

Between dispatch and the session's first move nothing is labeled, so the
dispatcher reads the spawn runs themselves to fill the gap. A run of
`agent-implement.yml` holds its issue while it is queued or in progress, and
for a 30-minute grace period after it succeeds — long enough for the session to
boot and label the issue. A run that failed, was cancelled, or expired unclaimed
in the queue holds nothing, so the issue goes back in the pool and is dispatched
again on the next run. (Because the runs list is the guard, the dispatcher waits
for each run it fires to become visible before moving on.)

### The spawn-time re-check

A spawn job can sit queued for hours, so what was true when the dispatcher
fired it may not be true when the Mac finally picks it up. Before spawning
anything, `agent-implement.yml` fetches the issue again and does nothing if:

- **the issue is closed** — you finished it by hand while the Mac was asleep,
  and a session for it now would redo settled work; or
- **the issue already carries `agent-dispatched`** — a session is already on
  it, so this run is a duplicate that queued behind the first.

Both leave a notice on the run rather than failing it: nothing went wrong, the
work simply no longer needs doing. A manual run can override either check by
ticking **force**, which is how you re-dispatch an issue whose session died
holding the label.

### Scope rules

- Only issues labeled `ready-for-agent` are dispatched.
- An issue qualifies when **nothing blocks it** — either it lists no `- #N`
  bullets under `## Blocked by` at all, or every bullet it lists is closed.
- **Umbrella issues are always skipped**: epics (`[Epic]` title prefix) and
  specs (`Spec:` title prefix). A human slices these into per-milestone child
  issues; a single agent session should never attempt one.
- At most **3** issues are in flight at once — counting both issues that carry
  the `agent-dispatched` label and issues whose spawn run is still live. Ready
  issues beyond the cap are deferred; because every dispatcher run re-scans
  every open `ready-for-agent` issue, they're picked up automatically on the
  next run. While the Mac is offline the cap applies to the queue, so at most
  3 sessions pile up waiting for it.
- If a session gives up, it removes the issue's `agent-dispatched` label and
  comments — which frees a slot and makes the issue eligible again.

### Where sessions branch from

Every session starts on a fresh branch cut from **`origin/main`**, and the spawn
step fetches the Mac's clone immediately beforehand.

Both halves matter. Paseo branches off a ref in the clone at
`PASEO_PROJECT_DIR` and never fetches on its own, so left alone a session
inherits whatever that clone last saw. Nothing updates its local `main` — the
runner only ever adds worktrees — so it drifts further behind with every merge,
and sessions were starting from a `main` over a hundred commits stale. Basing on
the remote-tracking ref sidesteps the local branch entirely; fetching first is
what keeps that ref from being stale in its own right.

This does not replace the skill's own `git fetch origin main` and merge before
it opens the PR. Other sessions land work while a long one runs, so the base
still moves underfoot. Starting current just means a session reads today's code
on its first pass instead of rediscovering it at merge time.

Override the base with the `PASEO_BASE` repository Actions variable — any ref in
the clone, e.g. `origin/release`. An unresolvable one fails the run outright
rather than quietly branching somewhere else.

### Model, reasoning effort, permission mode, and base

Sessions default to **Opus 5 at high reasoning effort, in bypass mode, branched
off `origin/main`**. Four optional repository Actions variables override that
without touching the workflow (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables):

| Variable         | Default              | Passed as    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `PASEO_MODEL`    | `claude-opus-5`      | `--model`    |
| `PASEO_THINKING` | `high`               | `--thinking` |
| `PASEO_MODE`     | `bypassPermissions`  | `--mode`     |
| `PASEO_BASE`     | `origin/main`        | `--base`     |

Leave a variable unset (or set it empty) to fall back to the default — unlike
`PASEO_PROJECT_DIR`, none of the four are required. The defaults are pinned in
the workflow rather than inherited from the Paseo daemon, whose own defaults
move as new models ship.

See the current legal values with `paseo provider models claude` (efforts are
per-model, currently `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`/`ultracode` on the
Opus and Sonnet lines). Modes come from the provider:
`plan`/`default`/`acceptEdits`/`auto`/`bypassPermissions`.

`bypassPermissions` is the default because nobody is around to answer a
permission prompt in a detached CI session — the provider's own default
(`default`, "Always Ask") would stall the session on its first tool use until
the daemon times it out.

**The workflow validates the model and effort before spawning**, because
`paseo run` itself does not: given an unknown `--model` it creates the session
anyway rather than erroring, which would leave a typo'd variable silently
running every issue on the wrong model. So the spawn step checks the pair
against `paseo provider models claude --json` first and fails red — listing the
valid values — instead of dispatching. `--mode` and `--base` need no such
check; the CLI rejects an unknown mode outright, and a base ref it cannot
resolve fails the run before any session exists.

## Repo prerequisites

- **Create the `ready-for-agent` label** (repo → Issues → Labels): the
  dispatcher only ever considers issues carrying it. The `agent-dispatched`
  label, by contrast, is created automatically on first dispatch — the
  dispatcher creates it ahead of the session that will apply it.
- **Keep the `/label-and-implement-with-pr` skill** at
  `.claude/skills/label-and-implement-with-pr/`, along with the `/implement`
  skill it calls. The dispatch prompt is just
  `/label-and-implement-with-pr issue #<N>`, so the skill is what actually
  tells the session how to work — including claiming the issue with the
  `agent-dispatched` label and opening the PR. Without it a dispatched session
  receives an unresolvable slash command.

  `/implement` must **not** carry `disable-model-invocation: true`, unlike most
  of its siblings in the mirrored set. `/label-and-implement-with-pr` reaches it
  through the Skill tool rather than a user prompt, which is exactly what that
  flag refuses; with it set, every dispatched session hits the refusal halfway
  through and falls back to improvising against AGENTS.md. Keep the flag off in
  both the repo copy and the personal one, or a re-sync reintroduces it.
- **Use the `## Blocked by` convention** in issue bodies. The dispatcher parses
  `- #N` bullets under that exact heading:

  ```markdown
  ## Blocked by

  - #12
  - #15
  ```

  An issue with no such section (or an empty one) is treated as never-blocked
  and qualifies on any dispatcher run. Since the dispatcher only runs on an
  issue close or a manual re-scan, a never-blocked issue starts either the next
  time anything closes or when you run the workflow by hand.

## One-time Mac setup

1. **Register the runner**: repo → Settings → Actions → Runners → *New
   self-hosted runner* (macOS/ARM64), then install it as a service so it
   survives reboots: `./svc.sh install && ./svc.sh start`. Jobs queue for up to
   24 h while the Mac is offline/asleep.
2. **Paseo daemon at login**: make sure the Paseo daemon starts automatically
   (the desktop app's login-item setting) and that `paseo ls` works from a
   terminal. The runner looks for `paseo` on `PATH` plus `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
   `/usr/local/bin`, and `~/.local/bin`.
3. **Point at the checkout**: set the repository Actions **variable**
   `PASEO_PROJECT_DIR` to the absolute path of this repo's clone on the Mac
   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). Sessions spawn
   worktrees off this clone, and the spawn step fetches it first, so its
   `origin` must be reachable unattended as the runner's user (an SSH key with
   no passphrase prompt, or a stored credential helper).
4. **`gh` and `claude` logged in**: sessions read issues with `gh` and run on
   the Claude CLI's subscription login, so both must be authenticated for the
   account the daemon runs under.

## Manual dispatch

`unblock-dispatch.yml` accepts a manual run from the Actions tab, which
re-scans the backlog under the normal scope rules. This is how never-blocked
issues get started — nothing has to close first — and how you drain a backlog
after raising the in-flight cap or fixing a `## Blocked by` list.

`agent-implement.yml` also accepts a manual run with any issue number, which
bypasses the scope rules entirely — the escape hatch for an umbrella issue or
one you haven't labeled `ready-for-agent`. It still counts against the in-flight
cap: the run holds the issue while it is live, and the session it spawns labels
the issue like any other. The spawn-time re-check still applies — a closed or
already-claimed issue needs **force** ticked.
