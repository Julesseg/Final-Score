# iOS Swift App Template

A ready-to-dev iOS app skeleton with CI automations baked in, extracted from
[Quickie](https://github.com/Julesseg/Quickie). Ships with a placeholder
identity (`FinalScore` / `com.julesseguin.final-score`) that one script swaps for yours.

**What you get on day one:**

- **Two-layer architecture** — `Core/` is a pure SwiftPM package holding all
  business logic (testable with `swift test` on any platform, including Linux
  CI and Claude Code web containers); `App/` is a thin SwiftUI target with an
  XCUITest suite on top.
- **CI on every PR** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — Core unit tests on a Linux
  container (fast, no Mac needed) + full XCUITest run on a macOS runner.
- **Installable PR builds** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — every PR gets
  an ad-hoc–signed `.ipa` published to a GitHub Pages install site: open it in
  Safari on your iPhone, tap **Install**. Optional ntfy.sh push when a build is
  ready. Inert until you configure signing (see below) — PR checks stay green.
- **App Store / TestFlight releases** (`.github/workflows/release-appstore.yml`)
  — push a `vX.X.X` tag and a build is signed for the App Store and uploaded to
  App Store Connect (TestFlight). Uses an App Store Connect API key with
  automatic signing, so there are no provisioning-profile secrets to manage.
  Shares the signing certificate with the PR-build pipeline (see below).
- **Auto-dispatched agent sessions** (`.github/workflows/unblock-dispatch.yml`
  + `agent-implement.yml`) — when a merged PR closes an issue, `ready-for-agent`
  issues whose `## Blocked by` list is now fully closed each get a detached
  [Paseo](https://paseo.sh) Claude Code session spawned on a self-hosted Mac
  runner to implement them. Dormant until you set up the runner (see below) —
  PR and issue events stay green meanwhile.
- **Claude Code setup** (`.claude/`) — Conventional Commits enforced by a
  PreToolUse hook, a SessionStart hook that installs a Swift toolchain in web
  containers so `swift test` works there, and per-environment guidance about
  where the UI tests can run.

## Quick start

1. **Create your repo from this template** (GitHub → *Use this template*), then
   clone it.
2. **Rename the placeholders:**

   ```bash
   scripts/rename.sh Zenith com.acme.zenith
   ```

   This renames the Xcode project, scheme, targets, Core module
   (`FinalScoreCore` → `ZenithCore`), bundle ids, and the workflow `env` blocks in
   one pass. Review with `git diff`, then commit.
3. **Verify the fast loop:** `cd Core && swift test`
4. **Open `App/<Name>.xcodeproj`** in Xcode and run on a simulator.
5. Push a PR — CI runs immediately. The installable-build pipeline stays
   dormant until you complete the signing setup below.

## Repository layout

```
Core/                 SwiftPM package — ALL business logic + unit tests (Swift Testing)
App/<Name>/           SwiftUI app target (thin UI layer over Core)
App/<Name>UITests/    XCUITest acceptance suite (runs in CI on every PR)
.github/workflows/    ci.yml (tests) + release.yml (installable PR builds)
                      + release-appstore.yml (App Store / TestFlight on vX.X.X tags)
                      + unblock-dispatch.yml / agent-implement.yml (agent auto-dispatch)
ci/                   assemble-build-history.mjs + pipeline docs (ci/README.md)
docs/agents/          auto-dispatch setup (self-hosted runner + Paseo)
.claude/              Claude Code hooks & settings
scripts/rename.sh     placeholder → your identity
```

The split is deliberate: iterate against `cd Core && swift test` (seconds,
works everywhere), and let CI's macOS job be the canonical gate for UI
behavior. Keep logic out of the `App/` target so this stays true.

## Enabling installable PR builds (one-time)

The release pipeline builds a signed `.ipa` per PR and publishes it to
`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` (URL derived automatically — nothing to
configure). It needs an Apple Developer **paid** membership, four repository
secrets, and GitHub Pages enabled. Until the secrets exist, the workflow
no-ops and stays green.

### Step 1 — Apple Developer console

Everything happens at [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
under **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**.

1. **Register your test devices** — *Devices → +*. You need each iPhone/iPad's
   **UDID** (connect the device to a Mac: Finder → select the device → click
   the model/serial line until the UDID shows). Ad-hoc builds install **only**
   on devices baked into the profile.
2. **Create the App ID** — *Identifiers → + → App IDs → App*. Set the explicit
   bundle id to exactly what you passed to `rename.sh` (e.g.
   `com.acme.zenith`). Enable any capabilities your app uses (App Groups,
   Push, etc.) — the template's entitlements file starts empty, so none are
   required at first.
3. **Create a Distribution certificate** — *Certificates → + → Apple
   Distribution*. Upload a CSR generated on your Mac (Keychain Access →
   Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate
   Authority → "Saved to disk"). Download the `.cer` and double-click it so
   it lands in your login keychain **next to its private key**.
4. **Export the certificate as `.p12`** — Keychain Access → My Certificates →
   right-click the *Apple Distribution: …* entry → Export. Choose a strong
   password; you'll store it as a secret.
5. **Create an Ad Hoc provisioning profile** — *Profiles → + → Ad Hoc*.
   Select the App ID from step 2, the certificate from step 3, and the
   devices from step 1. Download the `.mobileprovision`.

> Adding a device later? Register its UDID, **regenerate the profile**, and
> update the `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` secret — old builds won't install on
> it. (TestFlight avoids UDID management entirely but is a different pipeline.)

### Step 2 — GitHub repository secrets

*Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.*
macOS `base64` doesn't wrap lines by default, which is exactly what the
workflow expects:

| Secret | Value | How to produce it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` | base64 of the `.p12` from step 1.4 | `base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | the `.p12` export password | — |
| `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` | base64 of the `.mobileprovision` from step 1.5 | `base64 -i AdHoc.mobileprovision \| pbcopy` |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | your 10-character Team ID | developer.apple.com → Membership |
| `NTFY_TOPIC` | *(optional)* ntfy.sh topic for build-ready pushes | pick any unguessable string; subscribe in the ntfy app |

The signing identity name and the profile's name/UUID are read out of the cert
and profile at runtime — nothing else to copy.

### Step 3 — GitHub Pages

1. *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:* **GitHub Actions**.
2. Enabling Pages auto-creates a `github-pages` **environment** that by default
   only lets the default branch deploy — so a PR branch's deploy is rejected at
   the gate (a ~1-second failure, no steps run). Fix at *Settings →
   Environments → github-pages → Deployment branches and tags*: choose **No
   restriction**, or keep *Selected branches* and add a rule matching your PR
   branch names (e.g. `claude/*`).

The `build-history` branch appears automatically on the first successful
publish. It's a derived store — force-pushed every run so multi-MB `.ipa`
blobs never accumulate in git history. Don't commit to it.

### Using it

Open a PR → the `Release` workflow archives, signs, exports, and publishes.
Visit `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` in **Safari on the iPhone** and tap
**Install** (the OTA `itms-services://` flow only works in Safari, and only on
devices whose UDID is in the profile). The site keeps the 5 most recent PR
builds (`RETENTION` in `release.yml`); reinstalling the same PR after a new
push registers as an update because the short commit SHA is the bundle
version. Pipeline internals: [`ci/README.md`](ci/README.md).

## Enabling App Store / TestFlight releases (one-time)

`release-appstore.yml` is a separate pipeline from the PR builds above. Where
`release.yml` produces **ad-hoc** builds for on-device testing, this one signs
for the **App Store** and uploads to App Store Connect, so the build shows up in
**TestFlight** and can be promoted to a public release. It runs when you push a
version tag `vX.X.X` (or from *Actions → Release (App Store) → Run workflow*).

Signing is driven by an **App Store Connect API key** with **automatic
signing**: `xcodebuild` creates/downloads the App Store provisioning profile at
build time, so — unlike the ad-hoc pipeline — there are **no `.mobileprovision`
secrets** to manage. Add app extensions later and their profiles are resolved
the same way, no workflow change. It reuses the same Apple Distribution
certificate (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` / `_PASSWORD`) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` you
already set for the PR builds.

### Step 1 — App Store Connect

1. **Create the app record** — [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   → *Apps → +* → *New App*. Use the bundle id you passed to `rename.sh`
   (e.g. `com.acme.zenith`); the App ID from the PR-builds setup above must
   already exist.
2. **Create an API key** — *Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect
   API → +*. Give it the **App Manager** role. Download the `.p8` file **once**
   (Apple only lets you download it a single time). Note the **Key ID** and the
   **Issuer ID** shown above the keys list.

### Step 2 — GitHub repository secrets

The three App-Store-specific secrets, on top of the certificate/team secrets
already configured for PR builds:

| Secret | Value | How to produce it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` | the API key's Key ID (e.g. `ABC123XYZ9`) | from step 1.2 |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | the API key's Issuer ID | from step 1.2 |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_P8` | the full contents of the `.p8` file | `pbcopy < AuthKey_ABC123XYZ9.p8` |

`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are
shared with `release.yml` — nothing to add if PR builds already work. Until all
six are present, a tagged run **fails fast** with a clear message (a deliberate
release shouldn't silently no-op the way the PR pipeline does).

### Cutting a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow stamps `MARKETING_VERSION` from the tag (`v1.0.0` → `1.0.0`) and
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from the CI run number, archives with automatic
signing, exports an App-Store-signed `.ipa`, and uploads it with `xcrun altool`.
Because the build number is the run number, every upload is unique and
increasing — App Store Connect rejects duplicate build numbers for a version.
Processing in TestFlight takes a few minutes after the run goes green; set
`NTFY_TOPIC` to get pinged when the upload finishes. The signed `.ipa` is also
attached to the run as an artifact (7-day retention). A misformatted tag (not
`X.X.X`) fails the run early rather than uploading a bad version.

## Enabling agent auto-dispatch (one-time)

The auto-dispatch pipeline (`unblock-dispatch.yml` + `agent-implement.yml`)
spawns a detached [Paseo](https://paseo.sh) Claude Code session per newly
unblocked issue. Until you complete this setup, `unblock-dispatch.yml` runs on
issue-close events but finds nothing to dispatch, and `agent-implement.yml`
never runs — both stay green.

1. **Create the `ready-for-agent` label** and write blockers as `- #N` bullets
   under a `## Blocked by` heading in issue bodies — that's what the dispatcher
   scans for.
2. **Add an `/implement` skill** at `.claude/skills/implement/` — the dispatch
   prompt is just `/implement issue #<N>`, so the skill is what tells the
   session how to work. Not shipped with this template.
3. **Register a self-hosted macOS runner** (repo → Settings → Actions →
   Runners) on a Mac with the Paseo daemon running and `gh` + `claude` logged
   in.
4. **Set one required repository Actions variable** (*Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions → Variables* — a variable, not a secret):

   | Variable | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `PASEO_PROJECT_DIR` | Absolute path of this repo's clone on the runner Mac; agent sessions spawn git worktrees off it |

   Three more are optional: `PASEO_MODEL`, `PASEO_THINKING`, and `PASEO_MODE`
   override the pinned defaults (Opus 5, high effort, bypass mode).

Full walkthrough, scope rules, the in-flight cap, and the optional variables:
[`docs/agents/auto-dispatch.md`](docs/agents/auto-dispatch.md).

## CI details

- **`ci.yml`** — `core-tests` runs `swift test` in a `swift:6.0.3` Linux
  container; `app-ui-tests` builds and runs the XCUITest suite on `macos-15`
  with the latest stable Xcode against the newest available iPhone simulator,
  unsigned (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`). The `.xcresult` bundle is uploaded as
  an artifact on every run.
- **Deployment target** is iOS 26.0 (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in the
  pbxproj) with Swift 6 — adjust to your needs.
- Workflows read the app identity from one `env:` block each (`APP_NAME`,
  `BUNDLE_ID`), which `rename.sh` rewrites.

## Claude Code integration

`.claude/settings.json` wires three hooks:

- **`validate-commit-msg.py`** (PreToolUse) — blocks `git commit` unless the
  subject follows Conventional Commits. Deliberately permissive: merges,
  reverts, amends, and messages it can't parse statically pass through.
- **`session-start.sh`** (SessionStart) — on Claude Code web containers
  (Linux), asynchronously installs the Swift 6.0.3 toolchain so `cd Core &&
  swift test` works there. No-op on a local Mac.
- **`platform-guidance.sh`** (SessionStart) — tells the agent whether this
  machine can run the XCUITest suite (a Mac with Xcode can; a Linux container
  cannot — CI is the gate there).

`AGENTS.md` carries the matching conventions (commit/PR-title format, "always
implement the UI, let CI verify it"). Customize both for your project.
